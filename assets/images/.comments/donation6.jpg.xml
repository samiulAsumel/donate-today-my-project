  <note>MUZAFFARGARH, PAKISTAN - AUGUST 20: Villagers, displaced from their homes by flooding, fight for bags of flour during relief distribution on August 20, 2010 on the outskirts of Muzaffargarh in Punjab, Pakistan. The country&apos;s agricultural heartland has been devastated, with rice, corn and wheat crops destroyed by floods. Officials say as many as 20 million people have been affected during Pakistan&apos;s worst flooding in 80 years. The army and aid organizations are struggling to cope with the widespread scale of the disaster that has killed over 1,600 people and displaced millions. The UN has described the disaster as unprecedented, with over a third of the country under water.  (Photo by Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images)</note>
